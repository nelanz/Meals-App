# Meals App (aka Food App)

Another Flutter project made during Flutter & Dart course. **Link:** https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps/.

## Brief Description 

This project was made with the instructor during Flutter &amp; Dart
Course that I took during summer 2019. The app represents some meals
with their recipes. User can also mark chosen meals as favourite or use
some toggle buttons to search for vegan, vegetarian, lactose-free or
gluten-free options. I did some changes to the UI and data adding Polish
category for all my Pierogi lovers ðŸ¥Ÿ.
